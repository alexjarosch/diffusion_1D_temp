# diffusion_1D_temp

Thermal diffusion model utilizing the finite difference method in 1D. It uses a central scheme in space and a froward Euler time-stepping scheme to progress time, stabilisiere with a CFL condition.

## Requirements

* Python 3.X, I used 3.8.2
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* TKinter

Install and running the model is rather simple, install the dependencies above, then you can download (or clone) the model and run it in a shell.
